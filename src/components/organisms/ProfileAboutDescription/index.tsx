            Hello! My name is Bruno Mello, and I am a backend development
            student. At 25 years old, I graduated in Systems Analysis and
            Development from the SÃ£o Paulo State Technological College (FATEC
            Mococa). I have a passion for technology, teamwork, and a strong
            desire for continuous learning. Currently, I work as a junior
            developer with experience in React.js, React Native, TypeScript,
            styled-components, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, PHP, Express.js, Git,
            GitHub, SQL, Docker, and the Kanban methodology. I am always looking
            to expand my knowledge in these areas and explore new technologies.
            If you would like to learn more about my experience and skills, I
            have provided my resume for download. Feel free to download it and
            examine it in more detail. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and
            I hope to see you again soon!
